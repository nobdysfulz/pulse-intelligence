PULSE Intelligence: The AI That Tells You What To Do Every Day To Grow Your Business

Stop Guessing. Start Executing. Hit Your Income Goals.

Every morning, thousands of real estate agents wake up and ask the same question: "What should I actually DO today to make money?"

PULSE Intelligence answers that question before you even ask it.

The Problem Every Agent Knows (But Won't Say Out Loud)
You've got your license. You've watched the training videos. You know you need to "prospect, follow up, and build relationships."

But when you sit down at your desk with your coffee, you stare at a blank screen wondering:
Which leads should I call first?
What do I say to them?
What should I post on social media?
Should I door-knock or send emails?
Am I even working on the right activities?

We’ve realized that you don't need more strategies. You need someone to tell you exactly what to do, when to do it, and in what order.

What Makes PULSE Intelligence Different
Other platforms give you ideas. PULSE gives you instructions.

While other "coaching" platforms ask YOU what you want to work on, PULSE already knows. It reverse-engineers your income goal, analyzes your market, and generates your exact daily action plan.

No planning sessions. No strategy calls. No figuring it out.

Just open the app and start with Task #1.

How It Actually Works
1. Set Your Income Goal
Tell us what you want to earn. PULSE calculates exactly how many conversations, appointments, listings, and closings you need.

2. Wake Up to Your Daily Roadmap
Every day, you’ll click 1 button to generate a new specific set of tasks for the day. Not generic ideas. Your exact next to-do steps.

3. Execute and Track
Check off each task. Our PULSE AI learns what works for you, how you work, and adjusts tomorrow's plan accordingly.

Example Tuesday:
Post about a City Weekend event
Post a poll about home-buying trends on LinkedIn
Call 5 referral partners and invite them for coffee
Gather client testimonials
Schedule client check-in calls for tomorrow

Platform Features & Benefits
Pulse AI is a comprehensive platform designed to empower real estate agents by leveraging artificial intelligence to streamline operations, enhance client interactions, and drive business growth. Here's a breakdown of its key features:

1. AI-Powered Daily Action Planning
What it does: Generates a personalized list of daily tasks and activities for the agent, tailored to their goals, market, and current performance. It integrates with a user's preferences to adjust the volume and type of tasks (e.g., "Get Moving," "Do The Most").

Problem it solves: Agents often struggle with prioritizing tasks, knowing what activities will yield the best results, and maintaining consistency. This feature eliminates guesswork and provides a clear roadmap.

Benefit to user: Maximizes productivity, ensures focus on high-impact activities, and helps agents consistently work towards their GCI and transaction goals. It prevents analysis paralysis and keeps them accountable.

2. PULSE Performance Scorecard
What it does: Calculates and displays a real-time "PULSE" score (Planning Adherence, Urgency Management, Lead Engagement, Systems Utilization, Execution Consistency) based on various business metrics like goal progress, task completion, and system setup.

Problem it solves: Agents lack a clear, consolidated view of their business health and specific areas needing improvement. Traditional metrics can be overwhelming or don't provide actionable insights.

Benefit to user: Provides an instant, holistic snapshot of their business performance, clearly identifying strengths and weaknesses. The segmented score guides agents on exactly where to focus their efforts for maximum impact.

3. 12-Month Production Goal Planner
What it does: A guided, multi-step wizard that helps agents define their annual GCI (Gross Commission Income) goal, personal and business expenses, desired deal structure (buyer/seller split, commission), and then calculates the exact number of transactions, sales volume, and corresponding daily/weekly activities (conversations, appointments) required to hit that goal.

Problem it solves: Many agents set arbitrary goals without a clear, data-backed plan to achieve them. They don't know the specific activity levels needed to reach their income targets.

Benefit to user: Transforms abstract income targets into concrete, actionable steps. Agents gain clarity, confidence, and a quantifiable roadmap, making their goals feel achievable and providing motivation.

4. Market Intelligence & Analysis
What it does: Provides real-time market data (median home price, days on market, inventory supply, homes sold), trends, and AI-generated coaching insights for the agent's specific primary market territory and chosen ZIP codes. It also allows agents to ask custom AI questions about their market.

Problem it solves: Agents need up-to-date, hyper-local market knowledge to advise clients effectively, but gathering and interpreting this data can be time-consuming and complex.

Benefit to user: Positions agents as local market experts, enabling them to confidently answer client questions, identify emerging opportunities, and tailor their strategy based on current conditions. The custom AI query acts as a dedicated market research assistant.

5. Personal AI Business Advisor
What it does: A conversational AI interface that acts as a personal coach, providing real-time, personalized guidance based on the agent's unique profile, goals, performance data, and market configuration. It uses a knowledge base for additional context and adapts its coaching style (supportive, balanced, direct).

Problem it solves: Agents often need instant advice on specific business challenges, but human coaches aren't always available. Generic advice doesn't apply to their unique situation.

Benefit to user: Provides instant, confidential, and highly personalized coaching whenever needed. It helps agents make better decisions, overcome roadblocks, and stay on track with their goals, feeling supported every step of the way.

6. AI-Powered Role-Play Simulator
What it does: Offers interactive, voice-based role-playing scenarios powered by advanced AI prospects. Agents can practice handling common objections (e.g., price, timing, agent selection) and difficult client personas in a realistic, consequence-free environment.

Problem it solves: Agents struggle to confidently handle objections and tough client conversations. Lack of practice leads to fumbling responses and lost deals.

Benefit to user: Builds confidence and improves communication skills through repetitive practice. Agents can master scripts, refine their delivery, and be prepared for any client interaction, leading to higher conversion rates and a more professional demeanor.

7. Objection Scripts Library
What it does: A searchable and categorizable library of proven scripts for various real estate objections, with tips and context for each. Integrates with the role-play simulator for immediate practice.

Problem it solves: Agents often don't have ready-made, effective responses for common client objections, leading to hesitation and missed opportunities.

Benefit to user: Provides a powerful toolkit of effective responses, enabling agents to confidently overcome client objections and control the narrative during sales conversations.

8. Content Studio
What it does: Provides AI-generated and downloadable content packs (Social Media, Outreach, My Market) to help agents maintain a consistent and professional online presence. It also features individual content generators for social posts, video scripts, ad campaigns, market reports, and content calendars.

Problem it solves: Creating engaging, relevant, and consistent marketing content is time-consuming and requires specialized skills many agents lack.

Benefit to user: Saves countless hours in content creation, ensures a professional brand image, and helps agents effectively market themselves and their listings across various channels, attracting more leads.

9. AI Appointment Setter (more info below)
What it does: Allows agents to upload CSV lists of contacts for AI-powered outbound calls, using predefined scripts (e.g., Expired Listings, FSBO). It also supports single-call dialing. The system manages call initiation, tracks results, provides recordings, and generates post-call analysis. (Note: Currently in development/admin access only).

Problem it solves: Cold calling and lead nurturing are labor-intensive, often dreaded tasks that agents either avoid or perform inefficiently.

Benefit to user: Automates the tedious process of outbound calling and lead qualification, freeing up agent time to focus on high-value activities. It ensures consistent lead follow-up and appointment setting, scaling the agent's reach without increasing their personal workload.

10. Onboarding & User Preferences
What it does: A guided onboarding process (including a welcome video and checklist) and a comprehensive settings area where agents can configure their profile, market territory, notification preferences, AI coaching style, and activity mode.

Problem it solves: New users often feel lost in complex platforms. Agents need to customize the tool to fit their unique business and working style.

Benefit to user: Ensures a smooth start and a personalized experience. Agents can tailor the platform to their exact needs, making it feel intuitive and highly relevant to their daily workflow.

These features collectively aim to provide a powerful, intelligent co-pilot for real estate agents, addressing common pain points across business planning, lead generation, client communication, and personal development.

PULSE AI > Goals Page
The 'My Plan' page, often referred to as the 12-Month Business Planner in the PULSE AI platform, is a crucial tool designed to help real estate agents translate their annual financial goals into concrete, actionable steps. It's a structured, multi-step wizard that guides users through defining their income targets, understanding their business expenses, and breaking down complex financial objectives into manageable production and activity metrics.
This page isn't just about setting a target; it's about reverse-engineering success by showing users exactly what they need to achieve daily, weekly, and monthly to hit their annual goals.

Purpose of the Goals Page
The primary purposes of the 'My Plan' (12-Month Business Planner) page are:
Strategic Financial Planning: To help agents define a clear net income goal and account for all business and personal expenses, thereby calculating the Gross Commission Income (GCI) they truly need.
Production Goal Setting: To break down the required GCI into the number of transactions (buyer and seller deals) needed, based on their average sale price and commission rates.
Activity Planning: To translate production goals into daily, weekly, or monthly activities (e.g., number of contacts, appointments) required, using realistic conversion rates.
Goal Visualization & Tracking Foundation: To create the foundational BusinessPlan entity which then informs other parts of the app, like daily task generation, PULSE scoring, and goal progress tracking.
Guidance and Education: To guide agents through a proven planning process, even if they've never created a detailed business plan before.
In essence, it turns the daunting task of planning a successful year into a guided, step-by-step process with clear, quantifiable outcomes.

Functions Users Can Perform on This Page
The 'My Plan' page primarily functions as a guided planning wizard, allowing users to:
Create a New Business Plan: If no active plan exists, users can initiate a new annual plan.
View an Existing Business Plan: Once a plan is created, users can review its details, including financial summaries, deal breakdowns, and activity targets.
Edit/Update an Existing Business Plan: Users can revisit and modify their plan at any time, with changes dynamically updating calculated metrics.
Generate Associated Goals: Upon completion of the planner, the system can automatically create specific Goal entities (e.g., "Annual GCI Goal", "Total Deals Closed Goal") within the app, which then become trackable.

The PULSE Score: Your Business Health Monitor

The PULSE Score is a unique, dynamic metric designed to give you a real-time understanding of your overall business health and operational effectiveness. It's not just a number; it's a diagnostic tool that highlights your strengths and areas for improvement.
What is it? The PULSE Score is a holistic measure, ranging from 0 to 100, reflecting your performance across five critical pillars: Planning, Urgency, Lead Engagement, Systems, and Execution. It provides an immediate indicator of how well you're aligning your daily actions with your strategic business goals.
How it’s calculated: Each of the five pillars contributes up to 20 points to the total score. The calculation is dynamic, considering your recent activities, goal progress, and system utilization:
P - Planning Adherence: Measures how well you define and adhere to your business plan, set clear goals, and proactively organize your strategies. (e.g., having a business plan, active goals, recent goal updates).
U - Urgency Management: Assesses your ability to prioritize and complete tasks efficiently, especially high-priority and time-sensitive items. (e.g., number of overdue tasks, completion rate of high-priority tasks).
L - Lead Engagement: Reflects your proactive efforts in growing and nurturing your client base. This score is heavily influenced by the size and quality of your contact database. (e.g., contact count in CRM, lead follow-up activity).
S - Systems Utilization: Evaluates how effectively you leverage the platform's features, tools, and integrations to streamline your operations. (e.g., using task generation, setting up integrations, consistent use of features).
E - Execution Consistency: Monitors your overall follow-through on daily tasks and commitment to achieving your goals. (e.g., task completion rates, progress on goals).
How users can improve their score: To improve your PULSE score, focus on strengthening each of the five pillars:
Planning: Define a clear business plan, set specific and measurable goals, and regularly review and update them.
Urgency: Prioritize your daily tasks, especially "high" priority items, and proactively address overdue tasks. Don't let tasks pile up.
Lead Engagement: Actively grow your contact database, engage with your leads consistently, and leverage tools like the Leads Agent for outreach.
Systems: Utilize all available features – integrate your CRM, generate daily tasks, use the content studio, and track your progress within the platform.
